# cfiles, multi-formats analysis tools for chemistry

`cfiles` is an analysis frontend for the
[Chemfiles](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles/) library, implementing analysis
algorithms for post-processing data from molecular or quantum simulations.

This is still in alpha mode, largely untested, created for dog-feeding purpose and as such
it will surely eat your laundry and do nasty things. Feel free to use it, without any
guarantee about the result.

## Analysis functionalities

## Get it, build it
