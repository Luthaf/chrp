# chrp, multi-formats analysis tools for chemistry

`chrp` is the binary frontend to [Chemharp](https://github.com/Luthaf/Chemharp/),
implementing analysis algorithms for post-processing data from Molecular or quantum
simulations.

## Get it, build it

Be sure you have [installed](http://chemharp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html)
the Chemharp library, and then run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luthaf/chrp
cd chrp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

## How do you pronounce it ?

As you can, without broking your teeth! I try to say something like *sharp*, but very
quick and without any vowel.
